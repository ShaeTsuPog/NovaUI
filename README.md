# NovaUI for Minecraft 1.18.2
Clean and minimul dark UI for Minecraft with the aim of extensive mod support. 

Inspired by my desperate search to find a dark mode resource pack and discovering they all have spotty mod support. The goal is to unify various GUI elements across vanilla and modded Minecraft for a simple and easy on the eyes solution to my fellow night owls eyes. 

Many things currently look hacky as I'm still trying to work out exactly how I want things to look. Below you can see examples of GUI elements I'm mostly satisfied with.




<b>Currently Supported</b>
- Vanilla Minecraft (mostly)
- Sophisticated Backpacks
- Sophisticated Storage
- Applied Energistics 2
- Curios
- Extreme Sound Muffler
- Trash Slot
- Cosmetic Armor Reworked

<b>Coming Soon<i>ish</i></b>
- Pipez
- Refined Storage
- Mekanism
- Xnet
- RFTools
