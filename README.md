# NovaUI for Minecraft 1.18.2
Clean and minimul dark UI for Minecraft with the aim of extensive mod support. 

Inspired by my desperate search to find a dark mode resource pack and discovering they all have spotty mod support. The goal is to unify various GUI elements across vanilla and modded Minecraft for a simple and easy on the eyes solution for my fellow night owls. 

Many things currently look hacky as I'm still trying to work out exactly how I want things to look. Below you can see examples of GUI elements I'm mostly satisfied with.

<b>NOTE: This resource pack is intended to be used with [Modern UI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modern-ui) for the font rendering and blur effect.</b>
